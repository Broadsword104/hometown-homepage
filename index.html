        <!-- Stretch Goals:
            I chose NOT to add a new font - as I didn't find one I liked better(!)
            I chose NOT to use a different colour palette for the same reason(!)
            nor did I add a new Section - mainly as it took me a while to get it looking right as it is...
            nor did I find a good way to utilise the :hover functionality.
            I DID, however, make it about my Hometown - or at least where I currently live and added my own 'Strech goal' by creating and added my own <a href="Linky-things">to relevant Wikipedia pages</a> with target="_blank" but did not opt to also include the recommended Assisted reading 'link (opens in new tab)':  
            example: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikipedia.org">
                    Wikipedia (opens in new tab)
                 </a>
